These criteria eliminated every version-control system in use at the time, so immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release, Torvalds set out to write his own.[11]

The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.[17] Torvalds announced the project on 6 April and became self-hosting the next day.[17][18] The first merge of multiple branches took place on 18 April.[19] Torvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 patches per second.[20] On 16 June, Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release.[21]

Torvalds turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project.[22] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005.[23]
